# Platform Support

## Supported Platforms
| Platform | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Ubuntu (X11) | Tested | xdotool for text insertion |
| Ubuntu (Wayland) | Tested | ydotool for text insertion, clipboard fallback |
| Debian-derived | Best-effort | Likely to work, not regularly tested |
| Other Linux | Experimental | May work, not supported |
| macOS | Not targeted | Not in scope |
| Windows | Not targeted | Not in scope |

## Requirements
- Tauri runtime dependencies: libwebkit2gtk-4.1, libgtk-3, libayatana-appindicator3
- Node.js 20+ and Rust (for building from source)
- PulseAudio or PipeWire for microphone access
- xdotool + xclip (X11) or ydotool + wl-clipboard (Wayland) for text insertion
- No root privileges needed for normal operation

## Session Detection
The app detects session type via `XDG_SESSION_TYPE`:
- `x11` -> use xdotool for text insertion
- `wayland` -> use ydotool, fall back to clipboard paste
- Desktop environment detected via `XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP`

## Wayland Caveats
- ydotool works via uinput (kernel-level, compositor-independent)
- Requires user in `input` group: `sudo usermod -aG input $USER` (then log out and back in)
- Clipboard fallback uses wl-copy + ydotool Ctrl+V simulation
- Behaviour may vary by compositor (GNOME, KDE, Sway)

### ydotoold (ydotool daemon)

ydotool v1.0+ requires the `ydotoold` daemon to be running. On older versions (0.x), ydotool communicates with uinput directly.

**Check if ydotoold is needed:**
```bash
ydotool type "test"  # If this errors with "socket not found", you need ydotoold
```

**Start ydotoold:**
```bash
# One-time (current session)
ydotoold &

# Persistent (systemd user service, if available)
systemctl --user enable --now ydotoold
```

**If ydotoold is not available as a service:**
```bash
# Add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.profile for auto-start
pgrep -x ydotoold > /dev/null || ydotoold &
```

**Troubleshooting:**
- `Permission denied`: ensure user is in `input` group and has uinput access
- `Socket not found`: ydotoold is not running — start it manually
- If ydotool type-simulation fails, Voice falls back to clipboard paste automatically

## X11
- xdotool works via X11 protocol (compositor-independent)
- No special group membership needed
- Clipboard fallback uses xclip + xdotool Ctrl+V simulation

## Known Limitations
- Wayland text insertion depends on compositor support for uinput
- Flatpak may require portal permissions for mic access
- Some Wayland compositors block simulated input
- First launch requires internet for model download (~142 MB)
- AppImage build requires linuxdeploy tool installed separately

## Packaging
| Format | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| .deb | Working | Built via `./scripts/setup.sh --install` |
| .rpm | Working | Built automatically alongside .deb |
| AppImage | Requires linuxdeploy | Not built by default |

## Data Locations
| Data | Path |
|------|------|
| Config | `~/.config/voice/config.json` |
| Models | `~/.local/share/voice/models/` |
| Socket | `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/voice.sock` |
